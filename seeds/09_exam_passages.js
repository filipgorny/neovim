A deficiency of HCAII is associated with a disease called CAII deficiency syndrome (CADS). HCAII begins in an unfolded state in the body and undergoes a folding reaction to reach its native state (U→N). The successful folding to its native structure ensures that the protein functions correctly. Determining how these disease-related mutations affect the structure and stability of proteins not only helps to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the corresponding disease, but also facilitates understanding of the structure-function relationship of these proteins. Various mutations have been found to lead to distinct decreases in the activity of the enzyme and increases in the Gibbs free energy of the folding reaction. Experimental determination indicated that at least three mutations affect HCAII folding significantly and that the P237H mutation was the most deleterious one, suggesting that Pro237 was important to HCAII folding. To investigate the role of the 237th residue in HCAII structure and folding, the effect of substitutions of proline by various amino acid residues at position 237 was studied by both FoldX prediction and folding experiments (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/physchem/EK3_Physchem_P3_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> The change in Gibbs free energy induced by mutations</left><br/><br/><indent>The enzymatic activity of wild-type HCAII and the mutants were determined by the esterase activity assay, which monitors the appearance of </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>p</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">-nitrophenolate anion spectrophotometrically during the hydrolysis of p-NPA.

These techniques have the potential to improve health care delivery and therapeutic strategies for populations with HF. Currently, myocardial contractile function remains the key index in evaluating the severity and prognosis of HF.

Although non-consensual sex both in marriage and dating relationships is common, it is believed to be under-reported. Nevertheless, research shows that coercive sexual practices are endemic in heterosexual intimate relationships in southern Africa. One of the challenges in studying intimate partner violence is the definition of sexual violence, which also includes subtle, non-physical forms of coercion in which a partner consents to sex when they do not want it due to power inequalities and normative roles and practices. Gender discrimination and female subordination in Zimbabwe are historical and were strengthened by colonial administrative policies that subordinated women.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The colonial period saw the codification of customary practices into a rigid draconian law that discriminated against women, and, according to anthropologists, officialized male control over women’s sexuality. Due to the payment of bridewealth, the authority over a single woman’s sexual and fertility rights was transferred from fathers and brothers to husbands upon marriage, hence putting a woman’s entire lifetime under the control and subordination of men. In addition, the influence of the marriage institution and the church is also viewed as encouraging male domination of female sexuality. Date rape with the intention of impregnating a girl may be carried out if the girl refuses a marriage offer, and is generally perpetrated by poorer men who lack the money for bridewealth. These pregnancies usually result in violence later in the relationship. People interpret bridewealth as giving a married man unlimited access to sexual intercourse with his wife, making it difficult for women to refuse sex.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Women’s economic vulnerability further facilitates partner abuse. Given the recent harsh economic environment in Zimbabwe, where unemployment has been around 80%, risking the loss of a marriage or partnership with an employed man during pregnancy is detrimental to economic survival and the meeting of health needs. The burden of sexual violence is lighter for many women than the perceived economic burden of being divorced. It is in this broader environment of male domination of female sexuality and fertility rights that women continue to experience sexual violence in partnerships.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The last decade has been marked by an increasing acknowledgement of the role of normative gender roles and power inequalities in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and exploring the interconnections between gender-based violence and HIV infection. Zimbabwe is one of the few countries in the world that has criminalized marital rape in the context of HIV infection. The law also gives women power to seek protection orders against their violent partners. Despite these advances, women who get tested for HIV and seek condom use as an HIV preventive mechanism may experience coercive and unprotected sex from their partners who question the idea of using condoms in marriages. HIV testing among antenatal care attendees in Zimbabwe has shifted from a patient-initiated model based on the ‘‘opt-in’’ approach to a provider-initiated testing and counseling model in which all antenatal care attendees are invited to test, and only those who ‘‘opt out’’ will not be tested. However, unequal gender relations regarding HIV testing are prevalent, as men refuse to get tested but expect to infer their HIV status from their partners’ results.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>That Pregnancy Can Bring Noise into the Family</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">: Exploring Intimate Partner Sexual Violence during Pregnancy in the Context of HIV in Zimbabwe.” Shamu S, Abrahams N, Temmerman M, Shefer T, Zarowsky C. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2012. 7(8): e43148. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0043148 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 2, false);

In 2003, the pharmaceutical company Biovail became the subject of an investigation because it paid $1,000 per patient to American physicians who managed to renew prescriptions of its new drug for at least 11 patients. A general opinion by the American Medical Association’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs on conflicts of interest, however, indicates that remuneration that is “commensurate with the efforts of the researcher on behalf of the company” is acceptable.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The increasing prevalence of recruitment incentives is directly related to growing competition between research sponsors. More pharmaceutical clinical trials are being undertaken than ever before. In addition, there is a trend toward larger trials and a widespread industry belief that speed of testing is as crucial as recruiting sufficient numbers of patients. An industry source noted that a single day’s delay in getting a drug to market costs $1.3 million.</indent><br/><br/><indent>These incentives may partly explain the increasing involvement of community-based physicians in clinical research. Their patient bases are seen as an untapped reserve of potential research participants. Academic physician researchers, in turn, now feel they must compete with community-based physicians for recruitment incentives, either for personal gain or to pay researchers’ salaries. The prospect of considerable fees for referrals may interfere with the judgment of physicians trusted by patients to act in their best interests. A related concern is potential interference with consent processes. Fraudulent behavior can be dealt with under criminal law, but other forms of influence are likely to be more subtle and therefore harder to control.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Safety is another important concern: financial interests associated with the recruitment of research participants may encourage researchers to disrespect inclusion and exclusion criteria, putting patients at risk. Safety concerns may be amplified with the involvement of community-based physicians, who may lack experience in research, who may be overburdened, and who work more in isolation, perhaps making it harder to critically evaluate and discuss research benefits and risks with other professionals. Recruitment incentives are implicated in the distortion of research agendas and priorities. Researchers who conduct publicly funded research may encounter difficulties recruiting patients because they cannot offer significant recruitment incentives. As a result, valuable research may be neglected in favor of research that is of sometimes questionable scientific importance and clinical value.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Academic Internal Review Boards (IRBs) created to approve and monitor research with human subjects often lack independence or suffer the perception of bias because of the interests of their host institutions in the approval of research. Further, for most clinical trials involving community-based physicians, commercial IRBs are employed. The legitimacy of the review provided by these IRBs is undermined by an inherent conflict of interest, given that they are paid to make a decision that has an immediate impact on the financial interests of their clients.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The problems raised by finder’s fees cannot be resolved by focusing exclusively on sanctioning the individuals who may accept them. They ought to be addressed as part of a broader institutional and regulatory reform effort that includes specific guidance on broad conflict-of-interest issues.</indent><br/><br/><indent>A task force of the Association of American Medical Colleges strongly recommends that institutions separate the financial management of research from their conduct and oversight, and, further, that they establish independent conflict-of-interest committees.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Other solutions are more radical and simpler. One option is to establish an independent national institute for drug testing, to ensure the reliability of the data supporting drug approval. Proposals such as this would provide a check on competition for research participants. Strict guidelines on recruitment of, and payments to, patients could be established for these drug assessment centers, and clinical trials could be better coordinated. Centralization of patient recruitment and reduction in recruitment competition might make it easier to recruit patients for valuable research, thus also reducing pre-approval time windows.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Since this proposal requires a thorough overhaul of current drug-regulation structures, and since a complete overhaul of patient recruitment procedures will not occur overnight, it is important that regulatory and professional agencies immediately investigate other measures.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Regulating the Market in Human Research Participants.” Lemmens T, Miller PB. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS Med</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2006. 3(8): e330. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0030330 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 2.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 9, false);

Management of patients suffering from urinary tract calculi is considered to be a major healthcare problem because of its high prevalence and incidence. Over time, kidney stone treatment has significantly evolved from complicated open surgery to minimally invasive surgical procedures such as Extra Corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL). Because of its efficacy and minimal side effects, ESWL has become the first-line treatment modality for uncomplicated intrarenal calculi of ≤ 20 mm and proximal ureteral calculi of < 10 mm.</indent><br/><br/><indent>ESWL relies on the generation of longitudinal shockwaves with the use of a high-voltage current, which passes across a spark-gap electrode. The spark-gap electrode is surrounded by an ellipsoid reflector, and both are immersed in a water-filled coupling device placed at the level of the kidneys (Figure 1). The electrical discharge from the spark-gap electrode rapidly creates shockwaves in the water. These shockwaves are brought to a focal point by the reflector and propagate through the soft tissues, dissipating little energy until encountering the kidney stone. Energy is rapidly dissipated at the kidney stone because of the substantial difference in density between the stone and the surrounding tissues, resulting in fragmentation of the stone.</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/physchem/EK3_Physchem_P6_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Schematic of ESWL</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy for Management of Residual Stones after ureterolithotripsy versus Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy: A Retrospective Study.” Huang Z, Zhao X, Zhang L, Zhong Z, Xu R, Zhang L. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2013. 8(6) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0067046 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0).</small></span>', 8, false);

Approximately 75% of the world’s population loses the ability to completely digest a physiological dose of lactose after infancy, so commercial use of beta-galactosidase has received widespread interest and application in food technology. When the protein fails to fold correctly, inactive proteins can aggregate and form toxic prions, resulting in neurodegenerative disease.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In one study, chickpea beta-galactosidase was purified and samples for spectroscopic measurement were centrifuged and filtered through 0.45 μm filters.

In order to study this phenomenon, beta-galactosidase was added to prepared solutions of varying pH levels and enzymatic function was measured (see the gray line in Figure 1). Next, aliquots were withdrawn from samples of enzyme incubated with varying pH levels and added to the standard reaction mixture of pH 2.8 to assess whether enzymatic activity could be restored to standard activity (see the black line in Figure 1). A 75% cutoff was used to assess the restoration of enzyme function. Temperature trials were also completed to assess the effect of heat on enzyme denaturation and loss of function (Figure 2).

It is not uncommon today for an artist to work at one time in an abstract style, at another in a Neo-classical or Neo-medieval style, and at still another in an Impressionist style. Archaism in antiquity was never so varied as it is today, nor was it ever used in quite the same virtuoso-like way, but it does have a long history in Greco-Roman art. Its principal flowering came in the late Hellenistic period, especially in Hadrianic art, but its roots, like so many other innovations in Greek art, are traceable to the period between 480 and 450 B.C., when it is quite apparent in the work of a group of Attic vase painters, of whom the foremost was the Pan Painter.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The Pan Painter could and did paint in a full-blown Early Classical style, but he often chose to use a style which employed many of the mannerisms which had been common in Attic red-figure around 490 B.C., including the use of neat zig-zag patterns rather than the normal broad tubular forms of the Early Classical period for the folds of the drapery, and the use of highly stylized gestures rather than facial expression to convey dramatic action. All of these features can be seen in the depiction of the death of Actaeon on the Pan Painter’s ‘name piece’: the cloak over Artemis’ shoulders is rigidly, if pleasantly, patterned (compared to the more free and natural folds in Actaeon’s cloak); her step is that of a graceful dancer; her face, with its small mouth and the simple almond-shaped eye with a black dot for an iris is highly simplified; Actaeon’s agony is all mannered, ornate gesture.</indent><br/><br/><indent>What made the Pan Painter turn back to a style which had been in vogue thirty years before his own time? One suspects that it was partly because he sensed that the new developments in large-scale painting were inimical to vase painting and strained the limits of its technique. Vase painting was basically a matter of decorating the surface of household objects; the illusion of spatial recession clashed with the inescapable feeling of solidity associated with the surface of a vase; and subtle, dramatic expression probably tended to become obscured or to be felt inappropriate in wine cups and water jars. It seems likely that the Pan Painter was attempting to reassert the importance of the purely decorative function of his art. But it is probably also true that he perceived a certain quaint character in the vases made by the painters a generation before him and found a certain nostalgic pleasure in recreating it in his own more ambitious age.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Vase painters were much freer than sculptors to indulge their private artistic whims. A statue may take months, even years, to produce and each step in its production requires careful planning. The average vase painter produced perhaps thousands of paintings in the course of a career. There must have been times when boredom and the urge to ‘try something a little different’ became very strong. From such times, one suspects, arose not only the sophisticated archaism of the Pan Painter but also occasional caricatures, the interest in obscure myth, and the pure burlesque, which turn up in the Early Classical as well as in practically every other period of Greek vase painting.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Sculpture, on the other hand, was too costly a medium to permit the indulgence of whimsicality, and it seems doubtful that we find any true archaism in Early Classical sculpture. The metopes from Temple E at Selinus, it is true, have some Archaic features, but these are probably to be explained by a lag in development between the creative centers on the Greek mainland and the far edges of the Greek world. The Apollo from the west pediment at Olympia has a rather old-fashioned looking arrangement of curls over his forehead and also some rather hard, schematized details in the musculature of his chest. However, whether one interprets these features as true archaism or simply as an example of archaeological accuracy depends on how one interprets the significance of the Apollo in the pediment. If the Apollo is understood as a ‘statue of a statue’, we must conclude that the sculptor was probably simply attempting to reproduce the appearance of a cult image of an earlier era.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>Art and Experience</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> in Classical Greece.

The trials showed that hormone “replacement” therapy (HT), which was touted to treat estrogen “deficiency” in menopausal women just as thyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, not only did not reduce risk of cardiovascular disease but in fact increased risk of coronary heart disease, breast cancer, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Until the trials were published, the evidence was observational with the known likelihood of confounding, but researchers tried to control for those issues as well as they could and still found an association. The huge popularity of HT had resulted from the available evidence, and the steady stream of papers supporting HT for a multitude of diseases including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke had seemed to indicate consensus around the importance of HT.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The use of medical ghost writers by pharmaceutical companies was well established when Adriane Fugh-Berman’s paper was published. However, her revelations of Wyeth’s promotion of HT, culled from a collection of documents obtained from litigation brought by more than 14,000 plaintiffs who developed breast cancer while taking HT, were remarkable for their breadth and impact, shocking even the most cynical reader. Wyeth used several medical writing firms, but one in particular, DesignWrite, developed and implemented a publication plan on behalf of Wyeth to promote “HRT… a drug in search of a disease” for a number of conditions, ultimately publishing four trial reports and 20 review articles, a total of “over 50 peer-reviewed publications, more than 50 scientific abstracts and posters, journal supplements, internal white papers, slide kits, and symposia.”</indent><br/><br/><indent>Fugh-Berman outlines in excruciating detail the lengths to which DesignWrite went to promote Wyeth’s product. Not only were “authors” enlisted to put their names on the ghostwritten pieces, but the ghosts were careful to ensure the “authors’” hesitation about the lack of evidence or misleading messages did not undermine the underlying marketing messages. Responses to peer reviewers who challenged the flawed studies being cited implied that such criticisms were inappropriate: “The review of the current paper is not the appropriate place to criticize the methodologic flaws of published papers,” DesignWrite wrote for the authors.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Even the publication of the HERS and WHI studies was not enough to stop the torrent. Papers were developed to attack the HERS study, minimize the breast cancer risk of HT, and promote other potential unproven and unapproved uses. Wyeth and DesignWrite went so far as to develop material for a seminar, “Expert Forum on Breast Cancer Health,” subsequently published as a supplement complete with the opportunity to earn continuing medical education credit, all funded through an “unrestricted educational grant” from Wyeth. Far from being unrestricted, DesignWrite managed the drafts and responded to reviewer comments along with a member of the Wyeth marketing department.</indent><br/><br/><indent>While HT prescribing declined after publication of the WHI study, it is impossible to know how many women were adversely affected by prescribing influenced by these publications designed to please shareholders. As Fugh-Berman says, “Marketing messages in credible journals have almost certainly contributed to widespread use of HT among millions of women who had no medical indication for the drug.” In response to such actions by the pharmaceutical industry, some medical journals have developed policies wherein “the involvement of any professional medical writer in the manuscript must be declared” and authors must adhere to the ICMJE authorship guidelines and disclose conflicts of interest, all of which are published with the paper. However, no policies as of yet directly penalize companies for using ghostwriters in their publications.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Outing Wyeth and Their Hired Ghosts.” Winker, M. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLOSBlogs</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2014 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 5, false);

The primary effect of ischemic stroke to neurons is a massive shortage of energy supply with rapid depletion of glucose and oxygen, which impairs the synthesis of ATP through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The severity of the pathological consequences of stroke depends on the availability of alternative energy substrates and the rate of consumption of ATP by cells undergoing ischemic insults. Glycogen is the principal endogenous source of cellular energy alternative to blood-derived glucose during periods of energy deficiency in the brain.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Brain glycogen storage plays a significant role in both physiological and pathological circumstances by providing energy to adjacent neurons and axons. It also provides protection against reactive oxygen species produced during cellular injury. Studies using cell culture and optic nerve preparations have demonstrated that elevated glycogen improves neuronal survival and axonal function during glucose deprivation. Glycogenolysis also supports the de novo synthesis of glutamate in astrocytes during glutamatergic activity.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Researchers developed a model that suggests that glycogen can be used as a significant source of energy for astrocytes and can act as a regulator of astrocytic utilization of blood-born glucose. According to the model, glycogenolysis regulates utilization of extracellular and blood-born glucose by astrocytes, a type of glial cell, during brain stimulation by inhibition of astrocytic hexokinase. This makes extracellular and blood-born glucose available for use by neurons to meet the immediate demand of energy during brain stimulation. It is also used as a source of energy by astrocytes to scavenge excess glutamate during ischemic stroke-induced excitotoxicity. For these reasons, previous studies have reported that glycogen levels and metabolism are affected in pathological conditions such as cancer and neurological disease.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Molecular Basis of Impaired Glycogen Metabolism during Ischemic Stroke and Hypoxia.” Hossain MI, Roulston CL, Stapleton DI. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2014. 9(5): e97570 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097570 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 5, false);

In 1927 Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells produce twice as much ATP as normal cells through glycolysis, even in oxygenated tumors. Cancer cells have also been shown to be different from normal cells by reversibly down-regulating their oxygen consumption in response to increases in glucose: the Crabtree effect. Both of these metabolic effects are thought to be protective and contribute to cancer cell survival in a dynamic environment periodically experiencing low oxygen levels.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition which is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. BE develops as an adaptation to the erosive environment of acid-reflux with periodic hypoxic events due to ulceration and a restriction of blood supply to surrounding tissue. Given that esophageal cancer has been shown to display the Warburg effect, premalignant BE cells may be subject to selective pressure to adapt to variable oxygen and glucose concentrations before progression to cancer . A study was conducted to compare metabolic rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in four cell lines derived from individuals with BE at different stages of progression and measured changes in response to metabolic inhibitors and varying glucose concentrations.</indent><br/><br/><indent>BE cell lines CP-A, CP-B, CP-C and CP-D were previously derived from premalignant Barrett’s esophagus. CP-A was derived from a patient with early BE and low levels of genetic instability, while CP-B, CP-C and CP-D were derived from patients with later-stage BE containing high levels of genetic alterations. Extracellular acidification rates (ECAR), representative of glycolysis, and oxygen consumption rates (OCR), representative of oxidative phosphorylation, of each BE cell line and the fibroblast control cell line CRL-4001 were measured (Figure 1 and Figure 2). While carbon dioxide produced by cells also acidifies the culture medium, glycolysis accounts for approximately 80% of the ECAR. ECAR and OCR changes were measured in response to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a competitive inhibitor of the first-step in the glycolytic pathway.</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P5_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Change in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) upon addition of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in control and BE cell lines</left><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P5_fig2.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 2</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Change in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) upon addition of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in control and BE cell lines</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Warburg and Crabtree Effects in Premalignant Barrett’s<br/>Esophagus Cell Lines with Active Mitochondria.” Suchorolski MT, Paulson TG, Sanchez CA, Hockenbery D, and Reid BJ. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2013. 8(2): e56884. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056884 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License <br/>(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 6, false);

Race is associated with many healthcare disparities. Relative to white Americans, black Americans experience higher rates of diseases, disability, and premature death. Studies have also shown that black patients are systematically undertreated for pain and are less likely than white patients to receive pain medication; when they do, they receive less. A recent study proposed that one reason black patients are undertreated for pain may be that people, including medical personnel, assume that black patients feel less pain than white patients.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Complicating this issue is the influence of status on race perception. There is growing evidence that race can be cued by nonphysical characteristics. A study asked participants to categorize faces affixed to either high-status business attire or low-status janitor attire as White or Black on a computer screen. The results indicated that low status cues made a Black categorization more probable, whereas high-status cues made a White categorization more probable; this influence grew stronger when race became more ambiguous. Using computer mouse trajectory analysis, the study found that even in those categorization responses that were not affected by the status cue, the processing of the status cue nevertheless triggered the partial parallel activation of the other race category with which it was associated.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In another study, participants were randomly shown pictures of middle-aged Black and White target persons in business attire. They were told to imagine that the person was either of lower, equal, or higher status than themselves. Next, participants were asked to report how much pain they would feel if they accidentally stapled their own hand with an industrial stapler and how much pain the other person would feel if s/he accidentally stapled his or her hand with an industrial stapler.

According to this standard, when a patient loses decisional capacity and has not provided doctors with sufficient guidance about what type of care he or she wishes to receive or forego, health care providers should identify an appropriate surrogate decision maker. They should then instruct the surrogate to make medical decisions based on their judgment of what the patient would most likely have chosen for himself or herself. The rationale is that it would be unfair to deprive an incompetent patient of decision-making rights merely because he or she is no longer autonomous. This emphasis on preserving patient self-determination emerged in the years following the Belmont Report, when the report’s principle of respect for persons was rearticulated as a mandate to respect a patient’s autonomy.</indent><br/><br/><indent>By promoting patient autonomy even for those who can no longer express their own wishes, the substituted judgment standard departs from earlier ethical norms. For centuries, physicians themselves were expected to discern the right and good thing to do when presented with a medical decision. In the latter part of the twentieth century, U.S. medical ethics shifted its focus to maintaining four principles: non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and justice. Of these principles, autonomy is the one least emphasized in traditional norms, but it has gradually become the leading principle of clinical ethics. As a result, doctors are now taught that they are not to ask what is best for patients who can no longer express their wishes, but rather are to respect such patients’ autonomy even when that autonomy cannot be expressed by the patients themselves.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Conceptually, the substituted judgment standard is clouded by problematic presuppositions. It is not self-evident to all that substituted judgment is morally comparable to self-determination, that autonomy and self-determination continue to have meaning when severe brain-damage has occurred, or that patients value self-determination as much as contemporary ethicists do. Moreover, some worry that the ‘‘absolutization’’ of autonomy may ‘override good medical judgment and encourage moral detachment on the part of the physician.’ To the extent that medical students share these concerns when they learn about the practice, they may find it difficult to internalize substituted judgment and its related ethical principles. If students do not internalize the ethical principles they are being taught, they will not practice according to those principles when they enter the professional world.</indent><br/><br/><indent>To address this issue, advance care planning (ACP) is considered a central component of high quality palliative care; it is especially relevant for people who lose the capacity to make decisions at the end of life, which is the case for many nursing home residents with dementia. ACP is loosely defined as “any communication process between the patient and his or her care providers, which may involve family or friends, about the goals and desired direction of care at the end of life in the event of loss of capacity to make decisions.” How can the act of writing out an ACP improve medical outcomes? A number of hypotheses have been formulated.</indent><br/><br/><indent>First, the simple act of composing an advance directive might be the result of a psychological process by the individual, induced by a thorough process of communication concerning their preferred care at the end of life, ultimately resulting in dying with less fear and anxiety. Second, in cases where an advance directive was present, a patient’s relatives might interpret his or her condition as emotionally better. Finally, caregivers may communicate with relatives about the dying process, positively affecting their own emotional state, and reassuring the patient and relatives.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Quality of Dying in Nursing Home Residents Dying with Dementia: Does Advanced Care Planning Matter?

When she sees a dog, she begins to sweat, her heart rate rises, and she feels a tightness in her chest that makes it difficult to breathe. Lily’s mother told her that when she was younger, she saw a neighbor’s dog bite her brother, who then reacted by crying and acting afraid of the dog. Lily wants to overcome her fear of dogs, but she finds it difficult because she feels like she loses control of her thoughts and emotions in the presence of a dog. To better understand learned fear, Lily volunteers to participate in a study at a local university. She hopes that the researchers can explain to her what has caused her fear of dogs.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The researchers intended to determine whether serotonin modulates learned fear. They used dietary tryptophan depletion to reduce brain serotonin (5-HT) levels in healthy human subjects. In a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, 5-HT depleted subjects exhibited attenuated autonomic responses to cues indicating an upcoming aversive event. These results were closely paralleled by reduced activity in the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex, two prominent structures of the neural fear circuit, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In agreement with current theories of serotonin as a motivational opponent system to dopamine in fear learning, the data provided empirical evidence for the involvement of serotonin in representing formally derived learning signals for aversive events.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “The Influence of Serotonin on Fear Learning.” Attar CH, Finckh B, and Büchel C. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS One</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2012. 7(8) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0042397 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 9, false);

Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is frequently associated with disturbances in iron homeostasis, with serum iron and hepatic iron stores being elevated. Iron is an important element for all living organisms, but can be toxic in excess. Because of this, iron metabolism must be tightly regulated. It is suspected that chronic HCV infection suppresses expression of hepatic hepcidin, a key mediator of iron homeostasis, leading to iron overload conditions. As a result of iron overload, iron deposition is another risk during chronic HCV infection. Excess iron accumulation can be highly toxic, and contributes to liver injury by inducing oxidative stress.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Iron is first absorbed in the duodenum by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). After entering the cytoplasm of enterocytes, iron can either be stored in ferritin or transferred to the bloodstream by the basolateral exporter ferroportin (Fpn). Hepcidin is thought to mediate degradation of ferroportin (Fpn). Thus in CHC patients, iron levels are expected to be elevated. In order to investigate the relationship between hepcidin, Fpn, and iron, researchers measured levels of each of these in CHC patients and compared these results to those of controls (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P10_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Iron, hepcidin mRNA, and Fpn protein levels in CHC patients vs. controls</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Duodenal Ferroportin Is Up-Regulated in Patients with Chronic Heptatitis C.” Ma L, Zou T, Yuan Y, Lv J, Dong X, Yang G, Zhu Y, Luo J, Zhang Z, and Yang J. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2014. 9(10) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110658 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 13, false);

Hearing problems including hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and hyperacusis (oversensitivity to sound) are primarily caused by damage to the peripheral and/or central auditory systems. While there is increasing evidence of a relationship between stress and hearing problems, causality is not well-established.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Researchers wished to explore whether acute stress would increase auditory sensitivity in individuals with high levels of emotional exhaustion (EE). Participants were first evaluated for EE through a questionnaire and were divided into three groups: high, moderate, and low EE. Participants were then exposed to sounds of variable intensity at four different frequencies. The uncomfortable loudness level (ULL) was defined as the intensity that the participant perceived as uncomfortably loud. All subjects were then exposed to three stressful tasks.

One method found to decrease stereotyping and prejudice is increasing contact between different social groups. The problem with this method is that although prejudice and stereotyping may beget a host of negative behaviors, such as derogation and aggression, a more common reaction in day-to-day life is avoidance and reluctance to interact with stereotyped outgroups. Although contact can decrease prejudice and stereotyping, prejudice itself may prevent willingness to engage in contact.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Intergroup contact has numerous social benefits, including a reduction in prejudice and anxiety about future intergroup interactions. However, it is difficult to generate willing and positive contact between groups. Although research has suggested that eliminating societal and structural constraints can provide the opportunity for contact, in reality, group members still remain reluctant to engage with outgroup members. Bringing people into contact when intergroup suspicion is rampant can exacerbate rather than ameliorate prejudice and conflict.</indent><br/><br/><indent>A group of researchers suggested that perspective-taking, or actively imagining another’s viewpoint, would increase individuals’ willingness to engage in contact with outgroup members. Study participants who were randomized to be perspective-takers were shown a picture of a stereotyped outgroup member and asked to put themselves in that person’s position before writing a paragraph describing a day in the life of that person. Control participants were asked to write the narrative without additional instructions. In Study 1 researchers found that perspective-takers subsequently sat closer to a targeted outgroup member. In Study 2 participants were shown pictures of other individuals from either the same target outgroup as in Study 1 or a different target outgroup. Participants were asked if they would be willing to complete an important task with the person they saw in the picture.

At this time, hyperactivity after administration of the dopaminergic agonist methamphetamine, but not the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine, was significantly enhanced in the irradiated rats, although spontaneous locomotion in the irradiated rats was significantly lower than that of controls.

Under selection pressures from host immunity, HIV-1 rapidly mutates, which allows the amplification of escape mutations that enable the virus to evade the host’s immune response. This ability to mutate not only causes problems with the host immune response, but also makes HIV-1 incredibly difficult to vaccinate against or treat. Analysis of the evolutionary patterns of a virus in the context of its host population sheds light on the selection pressures on viruses that are associated with specific host immune milieus. This type of information is useful in designing vaccines and drugs against the virus.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The evolution of the HIV-1 gag gene is of particular interest. Evolution in this gene and the epitopes to which the immune system can respond can be studied in order to develop better preventative treatments and therapies.

In 1927 Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells produce twice as much ATP as normal cells through glycolysis, even in oxygenated tumors. Cancer cells have also been shown to be different from normal cells by reversibly down-regulating their oxygen consumption in response to increases in glucose: the Crabtree effect. Both of these metabolic effects are thought to be protective and contribute to cancer cell survival in a dynamic environment periodically experiencing low oxygen levels.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition which is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. BE develops as an adaptation to the erosive environment of acid-reflux with periodic hypoxic events due to ulceration and a restriction of blood supply to surrounding tissue. Given that esophageal cancer has been shown to display the Warburg effect, premalignant BE cells may be subject to selective pressure to adapt to variable oxygen and glucose concentrations before progression to cancer . A study was conducted to compare metabolic rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in four cell lines derived from individuals with BE at different stages of progression and measured changes in response to metabolic inhibitors and varying glucose concentrations.</indent><br/><br/><indent>BE cell lines CP-A, CP-B, CP-C and CP-D were previously derived from premalignant Barrett’s esophagus. CP-A was derived from a patient with early BE and low levels of genetic instability, while CP-B, CP-C and CP-D were derived from patients with later-stage BE containing high levels of genetic alterations. Extracellular acidification rates (ECAR), representative of glycolysis, and oxygen consumption rates (OCR), representative of oxidative phosphorylation, of each BE cell line and the fibroblast control cell line CRL-4001 were measured (Figure 1 and Figure 2). While carbon dioxide produced by cells also acidifies the culture medium, glycolysis accounts for approximately 80% of the ECAR. ECAR and OCR changes were measured in response to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a competitive inhibitor of the first-step in the glycolytic pathway.</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P5_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"> Change in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) upon addition of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in control and BE cell lines</left><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P5_fig2.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><b>Figure 2</b></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"> Change in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) upon addition of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in control and BE cell lines</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Warburg and Crabtree Effects in Premalignant Barrett’s<br/>Esophagus Cell Lines with Active Mitochondria.” Suchorolski MT, Paulson TG, Sanchez CA, Hockenbery D, and Reid BJ. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;">. 2013. 8(2): e56884. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056884 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License <br/>(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 6, false);

As CHAD can interact with structural extracellular matrix molecules as well as with cells in the tissue, the protein may provide a mechanism for regulating cell activities in relation to ECM structure, and thus, play a role in both cartilage and bone homeostasis. To further study CHAD, researchers developed a transgenic mouse with inactivated CHAD genes. They subsequently analyzed bone and cartilage characteristics of these mice (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P9_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"> Force required to fracture femoral neck in CHAD inactivated mice</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “The Skeletal Phenotype of Chondroadherin Deficient Mice.” Hessle L, Stordalen GA, Wenglen C, Petzold C, Tanner EK, Brorson S, Baekkevold ES, Onnerfjord P, Reinholt FP and Heinegard D. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;">. 2013. 8(6) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063080 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 12, false);

Many prostate cancers are first identified through a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Both normal and malignant prostate cells secrete PSA, but blood PSA levels often rise in the presence of cancer. A PSA test is considered positive if the blood concentration of PSA is greater than 4.0 ng/mL. Definitive diagnosis is made through biopsy.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Based upon cell architecture, prostate cancers are graded according to the Gleason system. Scores can range from 2 to 10, with a lower Gleason score (GS) indicating a greater likelihood of having prostate-confined disease.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In addition to Gleason scores, cancerous lesions are also assigned a clinical T stage ranging from 1 to 4.

The primary effect of ischemic stroke to neurons is a massive shortage of energy supply with rapid depletion of glucose and oxygen, which impairs the synthesis of ATP through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The severity of the pathological consequences of stroke depends on the availability of alternative energy substrates and the rate of consumption of ATP by cells undergoing ischemic insults. Glycogen is the principal endogenous source of cellular energy alternative to blood-derived glucose during periods of energy deficiency in the brain.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Brain glycogen storage plays a significant role in both physiological and pathological circumstances by providing energy to adjacent neurons and axons. It also provides protection against reactive oxygen species produced during cellular injury. Studies using cell culture and optic nerve preparations have demonstrated that elevated glycogen improves neuronal survival and axonal function during glucose deprivation. Glycogenolysis also supports the de novo synthesis of glutamate in astrocytes during glutamatergic activity.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Researchers developed a model that suggests that glycogen can be used as a significant source of energy for astrocytes and can act as a regulator of astrocytic utilization of blood-born glucose. According to the model, glycogenolysis regulates utilization of extracellular and blood-born glucose by astrocytes, a type of glial cell, during brain stimulation by inhibition of astrocytic hexokinase. This makes extracellular and blood-born glucose available for use by neurons to meet the immediate demand of energy during brain stimulation. It is also used as a source of energy by astrocytes to scavenge excess glutamate during ischemic stroke-induced excitotoxicity. For these reasons, previous studies have reported that glycogen levels and metabolism are affected in pathological conditions such as cancer and neurological disease.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Molecular Basis of Impaired Glycogen Metabolism during Ischemic Stroke and Hypoxia.” Hossain MI, Roulston CL, Stapleton DI. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;">. 2014. 9(5): e97570 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097570 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 5, false);

Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is frequently associated with disturbances in iron homeostasis, with serum iron and hepatic iron stores being elevated. Iron is an important element for all living organisms, but can be toxic in excess. Because of this, iron metabolism must be tightly regulated. It is suspected that chronic HCV infection suppresses expression of hepatic hepcidin, a key mediator of iron homeostasis, leading to iron overload conditions. As a result of iron overload, iron deposition is another risk during chronic HCV infection. Excess iron accumulation can be highly toxic, and contributes to liver injury by inducing oxidative stress.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Iron is first absorbed in the duodenum by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). After entering the cytoplasm of enterocytes, iron can either be stored in ferritin or transferred to the bloodstream by the basolateral exporter ferroportin (Fpn). Hepcidin is thought to mediate degradation of ferroportin (Fpn). Thus in CHC patients, iron levels are expected to be elevated. In order to investigate the relationship between hepcidin, Fpn, and iron, researchers measured levels of each of these in CHC patients and compared these results to those of controls (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P10_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"> Iron, hepcidin mRNA, and Fpn protein levels in CHC patients vs. controls</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Duodenal Ferroportin Is Up-Regulated in Patients with Chronic Heptatitis C.” Ma L, Zou T, Yuan Y, Lv J, Dong X, Yang G, Zhu Y, Luo J, Zhang Z, and Yang J. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;">. 2014. 9(10) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110658 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 13, false);

The genetic basis of DS has not been elucidated, although chromosome 13 micro-deletion or duplication has been reported. Some DS patients have elevated chromosome breakage and tumor formation, implying potential defects in DNA repair. While certain DS cases have abnormal production of immunoglobulins, many other cases did not display immunoglobulin deficiency at young ages. Bone marrow failures have been reported in a few cases of DS. These clinical phenotypes overlap with some DNA repair deficiency syndromes such as Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) syndrome, Fanconi anemia, DNA ligase IV syndrome, Bloom’s syndrome, etc. However, direct evidence for DNA repair defects in Dubowitz syndrome has not been reported.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In order to establish a more complete cellular and genetic characterization of Dubowitz syndrome, researchers generated a fibroblast cell line, CoDa, derived from the skin tissues of a patient with Dubowitz syndrome.

The CoDa cells displayed typical fibroblast morphology in primary culture, and had comparable growth properties and cell cycle distribution as normal skin fibroblasts at log-phase of growth.

Sustained exposure to excess dietary fatty acids (FA) causes lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues with limited storage capacity. This lipotoxicity causes cellular stresses and inflammation that lead to cell damage, and contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Elevated levels of saturated FA are sufficient to induce lipotoxic stress in the hypothalamus and attenuate negative feedback responses to insulin and leptin, the hormones that regulate the metabolism and storage of FA, respectively. These effects contribute to dietary-induced obesity (DIO).</indent><br/><br/><indent>The increased oxidative metabolism that results from overnutrition generates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sustained high levels of ROS lead to oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function and ATP production. Increased ROS can also cause unfolded or misfolded proteins to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This ER stress initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that reduces protein translation generally, but upregulates expression of transcription factors X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and activating transcriptional factor (ATF) 4 and ATF6, to increase ER chaperone and degradation machinery that optimize protein folding. Excess FA induces ER stress and apoptosis, while central nervous system (CNS) administration of an ER stress inducer inhibits the effects of leptin and insulin in reducing food intake.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The hypothalamus is also susceptible to chronic inflammation from saturated FA, characterized by elevated interleukin (IL) 6, IL1b, and tumor-necrosis factor-a (TNFa).

The impact of DTCA on patient expectations can lead to inappropriate and excessive prescribing, but they may also induce a placebo effect that increases the clinical effectiveness of the advertised products. According to the expectancy-value theory, individuals are receptive to signals confirming their initial expectancies after administration of a placebo treatment. Many pharmaceutical advertisements teach viewers what to expect from the medication to capitalize on this conditioned response form of marketing. However, DTCA is mostly limited to expensive, new drugs for long-term use for common indications that are profitable to advertise. Such advertising increases premature rapid uptake and overuse of new drugs before flaws, including safety problems, have been discovered and communicated to health professionals.</indent><br/><br/><indent>A more dispassionate analysis would acknowledge three facts. First, prescription drug costs are rising rapidly—based on a confluence of increased prices, increased use of existing drugs, and introduction of new (more expensive) drugs, many of which are promoted directly to the consumer. Second, some drugs are clearly overprescribed, which implies that the benefits of taking the drug do not clearly outweigh the risks. The role of DTCA in this is unclear, although there is little question that advertising lowers the clinical threshold for prescribing. Third, there is substantial underuse of some safe and effective prescription drugs in the US. On a population basis, underuse of effective therapies may cause more deaths per year than overuse.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Given that some drugs are underused and others overused, an intervention such as DTCA that increases prescribing could have beneficial effects, deleterious effects, or both. While logically coherent, this conclusion could not until recently claim much empirical support. Investigators of a recent study trained actors to portray patients with major depression (a serious condition requiring treatment, referral, or close follow-up) or with adjustment disorder (a less serious condition in which supportive counseling might suffice). Actresses were randomly assigned to visit primary-care physicians in three US cities.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In half the visits, the actresses mentioned a TV advertisement and made a brand-specific drug request. In the rest of the visits they made no request.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Among actresses presenting with major depression, those making no request had only a 56% chance of receiving high-quality initial care (antidepressant prescription, mental health referral, or close follow-up) while those who made a brand-specific request for medication had a 90% chance. Among actresses presenting with adjustment disorder, the proportion receiving an antidepressant prescription was 55% if a brand-specific request was made, and 10% if no request was made. This means that requests associated with consumer drug advertisements could lead to many prescriptions at the very margins of clinical appropriateness.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In general, DTCA is most likely to deliver public health benefits when the condition to be treated is serious and when the treatment is safe, effective, and underused.</indent><br/><br/><indent>For obvious reasons, drug companies are not stepping forward with advertisements for the (often generic) medicines that are truly underused. The question for US policymakers is not whether DTCA should be banned, but how its benefits can be maximized and risks minimized. Two policy initiatives hold special promise. One is a two-year moratorium on DTCA of new drugs, coupled with a requirement for systematic post-marketing surveillance. In addition, the tax system could be used to create incentives for public–private consortia to produce mass media campaigns aimed at educating patients about common, serious medical conditions, and encouraging them to take evidence-based therapies.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “What Are the Public Health Effects of Direct-to-Consumer Drug Advertising?” Almasi EA, Stafford RS, Kravitz RL, Mansfield PR. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS Med</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2006. 3(3): e145. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0030145 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 7, false);

The last few decades of personality research and clinical praxis suggest that basic tendencies are constitutionally predisposed but are also developed and shaped during experiences with and within the environment.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Sensory ‘constitution’ could be an individual variable associated with and helping to form personality characteristics. This hypothesis is seated in the notion that people do not have an objective picture of the world surrounding them, but rather, a person-specific filtered one. The varying capacities of peoples’ sensory systems would form one part of a possible ‘sensory-filter’ system applied by all to their perception of their environment.</indent><br/><br/><indent>A group of researchers systematically explored coherence between a wide range of sensory thresholds and personality traits. A better understanding of how biological processes affect personality and behavior could have implications for medical science. The study used the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) to measure five personality dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Concomitant measurement of sensory thresholds focused on assessment of olfactory, trigeminal chemosensory, electrical, and gustatory detection thresholds, as well as establishing individual’s trigeminal chemosensory and electrical pain thresholds. Some results are shown in Figures 1 and 2.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Types of chemosensory perception including olfaction, gustation, and trigeminal perception are included amongst the evolutionarily ‘oldest’ senses. The olfactory channel processes scent and odor information from the environment. Gustatory perception is activated during eating and processes taste signals from food. Stimulation of the trigeminal chemosensory channel in a healthy person leads to perception of a burning/stinging sensation in the nasal cavity. Finally, stimuli processed through electrical cutaneous channels includes touch and tactile information.</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/psychsoc/EK3_Psychsoc_P2_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Odor detection threshold and agreeableness scores</left><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/psychsoc/EK3_Psychsoc_P2_fig2.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 2</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Gustatory detection threshold and neuroticism scores</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from "Agreeable Smellers and Sensitive Neurotics – Correlations among Personality Traits and Sensory Thresholds."

Countertransference has recently received attention as playing a more important role in therapy than was previously thought. The term is now used in an all-encompassing manner to refer to the analyst’s involvement in the therapeutic relationship.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In his book,</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i> Love’s Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">, Dr. Vabroom Yalom presents ten accounts of his therapeutical experiences with different patients. Yalom’s personal biases and mental associations are an intentional, essential part of the accounts. The calculated inclusion of his own emotional responses to his patients indicates that he does not simply play the role of impartial listener and observer. In fact the reader will discern that Yalom’s awareness of his own countertransference responses is part of what makes him an effective therapist.</indent><br/><br/><indent>According to Yalom, countertransference can stem purely from the therapist’s own experience, with the patient’s personality playing a very minor role in the therapist’s feelings. Further, countertransference is unavoidable and plays a part in every course of psychotherapy. However, in the account of “Fat Lady,” who is referred to as ‘Betty,’ countertransference is an essential factor in Yalom’s decision to aid the patient. It is Yalom’s desire to overcome his negative bias toward overweight women that spurs him to take on Betty as a patient.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Two aspects of Yalom’s decision are of interest when considering the role of countertransference responses in therapy. First, Yalom tells the reader that Betty represented “the ultimate countertransference challenge” and that this was his primary reason for initially accepting her into treatment. One then wonders if the patient is simply a tool for the therapist to “treat himself.” Yalom debates the ethical issues involved in deciding to treat a patient solely for the purpose of changing himself and sharpening his therapeutic skills. Yet, it would be naïve to overlook this as a possible motivation for many therapists’ decisions to commence treatment with a particular patient. The very fact that a psychologist must agree to begin work with a patient lends itself to having countertransference feelings as motivating factors. Although genuine concern for Betty does develop later in the relationship, initially it is the repulsion Yalom feels for her, and the curiosity about his own psyche, that are the dominant factors in his therapy.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The second aspect of Dr. Yalom’s decision that merits discussion is the admitted possibility of failing to overcome his countertransference responses and allowing them to influence the therapeutic alliance. Throughout the narrative of “Fat Lady,” Yalom doubts his abilities to listen empathetically to Betty, and to reply honestly to any question she might pose. He even wonders if the boredom that he experiences when listening to her is due to her personality, or boredom that he would experience when listening to any fat woman. He expresses to the reader his silent thoughts of disgust about her, which allows the reader to see the hidden progress of Yalom that occurs with Betty’s progress. He states that he is hopeful of change, but he admits that it is quite difficult to change something in him that has persisted for so long. However, despite the dangers present in Yalom’s decision to treat Betty, he works productively with her and helps her to become a more socially successful person. Indeed, Yalom lessens the possibility of hurting Betty by remaining acutely aware of his negative feelings toward her. Thus, Yalom consciously decides to shield Betty from his feelings, and give the other issues in her life that require therapy the priority in her treatment. In this way, Yalom enables himself to treat the patient and resolve his own countertransference issues simultaneously.</ident><br/><br/> </span>', 8, false);

Sustained exposure to excess dietary fatty acids (FA) causes lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues with limited storage capacity. This lipotoxicity causes cellular stresses and inflammation that lead to cell damage, and contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Elevated levels of saturated FA are sufficient to induce lipotoxic stress in the hypothalamus and attenuate negative feedback responses to insulin and leptin, the hormones that regulate the metabolism and storage of FA, respectively. These effects contribute to dietary-induced obesity (DIO).</indent><br/><br/><indent>The increased oxidative metabolism that results from overnutrition generates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sustained high levels of ROS lead to oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function and ATP production. Increased ROS can also cause unfolded or misfolded proteins to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This ER stress initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that reduces protein translation generally, but upregulates expression of transcription factors X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and activating transcriptional factor (ATF) 4 and ATF6, to increase ER chaperone and degradation machinery that optimize protein folding. Excess FA induces ER stress and apoptosis, while central nervous system (CNS) administration of an ER stress inducer inhibits the effects of leptin and insulin in reducing food intake.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The hypothalamus is also susceptible to chronic inflammation from saturated FA, characterized by elevated interleukin (IL) 6, IL1b, and tumor-necrosis factor-a (TNFa).

Activin, a transforming growth factor, is a hormone that regulates differentiation and proliferation of a wide variety of cells. The receptor for activin is highly expressed in the forebrain region. Activin protects neurons from oxidative damage, and its expression is upregulated by neuronal activity. Within the hippocampus, activin modulates neuronal morphology and is important for synaptic plasticity. Researchers explored the role that activin plays in anxiety-related behavior using a transgenic mouse model in which activin or follistatin, an activin-inhibitory protein, is overexpressed in a forebrain-specific manner. The amount of time spent performing risk-taking behavior, which inversely correlates with an animal’s level of anxiety, was measured for all groups (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/psychsoc/EK3_Psychsoc_P3_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Time spent performing risk-taking behavior in mice that overexpress activin, follistatin, or neither (wild-type)</left><br/><br/><indent>There is marked overlap and coincidence between anxiety and depression; depression is usually seen in patients with anxiety, and anxiety is often reported in patients with depression. Depression is a serious disorder in contemporary society. Many popularly prescribed antidepressant drugs work to modulate monoamine neurotransmission, and take six to eight weeks to exert their effects. Each drug is efficacious in only 60-70% of patients. Therefore, a conceptually novel antidepressant that acts rapidly and safely in a high proportion of patients would be highly advantageous. In a recent study, researchers showed that activin infusion into the hippocampus produced an antidepressant-like effect. Activin may represent a new contributing factor for the modulation of both anxiety and depression.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Activin in the Brain Modulates Anxiety-Related Behavior and Adult Neurogenesis.” Ageta H, Murayama A, Migishima R, Kida S, Tsuchida K, et al. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2008. 3(4): e1869 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001869 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 3, false);

At each evaluation, study personnel recorded all medications taken by the participants during the previous two weeks. A master list of medications defined as having probable or definite anticholinergic activity was constructed using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale, which has been previously validated. Participants were divided into never users, who did not use anticholinergic medications; prevalent users, who were using at least one anticholinergic medication at the time of study enrollment; and incident users, who were not using anticholinergic medications at the time of enrollment but began using one or more anticholinergic medications during the course of the study.

In early court decisions’ dicta, this principle was justified with the pretext that, since a contract’s subjective worth to any party might be far more than the objective monetary value of the benefit it provides, no judge should impose his own valuation on the benefit, and find it wanting. Under this justification, a coal mine was allowed to hire children to pull carts of ore in exchange for a few pence a (12-hour) day, since the starving child was always “free” to refuse, and the subjective value of those shiny coins was presumably much higher to the child in need than it would be to the mine owner’s children.</indent><br/><br/><indent>But in many ways—some obvious, some veiled—the concept of benefit influences the law of contract; it is pervasive and persistent, as it must be to ensure contracts’ intrinsic fairness.</indent><br/><br/><indent>A weighing of benefits and detriments is used in determining whether a contract is void for substantive<br/>“unconscionability.” Sometimes this is stated explicitly. A judge can, for instance, go so far as to declare a price too high as a matter of law. (This was done in </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>Jones v. Star Credit</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> where the judge ruled that a credit plan charging $1200 for a refrigerator which normally cost $400 was unconscionable.) While this conclusion seems fair and even obvious, we must not lose sight of the process of reasoning which led to it: The judge apparently decided the objective benefit of the refrigerator was properly reflected in the average price—$400—and concluded that the detriment to the Joneses—$1200—far outweighed that benefit. Yet this overt approach is judicially unpopular, and has been subverted by higher court decisions that above-market prices are not necessarily unconscionable.</indent><br/><br/><indent>However such cases have not eliminated the calculation of benefit, but just pushed it into the subconscious judicial mind. Today, for example, unfair contracts may be invalidated by a finding that one party lacked the education or intelligence to understand the terms of the contract. Still, it becomes necessary for the judge to calculate the benefit at some point. Imagine, for example, that Jones is excused from paying the $1200 on the grounds that his 8 years of schooling did not prepare him to understand the contract. Now, what would result if Jones leases the $400 refrigerator for only $350, but, for whatever reason, wants to invalidate the contract as unconscionable? Likely, no court would allow it. Yet it could not claim that Jones is any more able to understand the fair contract than the unfair one. The difference is merely that the benefit to Jones is now consistent with the price, which is what makes it “reasonable.”</indent></span>', 3, false);

Mention of the term is often followed by reference to Nazis.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Thirty years ago, few patients were candidates for genetic testing. Testing was only done on pregnant women of "advanced maternal age" (35+), women with a family history of a single-gene disorder, and women whose ethnic background was associated with higher prevalence of a specific inherited disease. Their risks justified the cost and potential dangers of the tests. Now the picture is rapidly changing as plummeting DNA sequencing costs and improved technologies are removing economics from the equation. It is becoming feasible to test anyone for anything—a move towards "pan-ethnic" genetic screening that counters the "sickle-cell-is-for-blacks and cystic-fibrosis-is-for-whites" mindset. Despite new targets revealed with annotation of human genomes, some of the detection technologies themselves are decades old.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Are these efforts the leading edge of a new eugenics movement?</indent><br/><br/><indent>There has been talk of genetic testing transitioning from targeted populations to the general public. Until recently, cell-free fetal DNA testing, or non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPT), was only advised for pregnant women at high risk of the fetus having an extra chromosome 13, 18, or 21, the most common trisomies – that is, women over 35, or women who had had a previous pregnancy with a trisomy. Today, entire fetal genomes can be sequenced from DNA snippets in the maternal bloodstream. Thanks to NIPT, many patients can avoid the slight risk of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. However, even though inconvenience and expense are quickly becoming eliminated as barriers to prenatal testing, there are parents who still decline to undergo testing or opt to carry a fetus with trisomy to term.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Children with trisomy 13 or 18 often do not survive beyond the first year of life. Donnie Heaton was a very rare case of a child affected by trisomy 18 who lived to turn 21.</indent><br/><br/><indent>Diana Bianchi, MD, professor of pediatrics at Tufts University, reported detecting cell-free fetal DNA and suggested noninvasive prenatal testing back in 1996. "If testing fetal DNA gives an all-clear, at least for the three most common chromosomal conditions, then a higher-risk pregnant woman can avoid the risk of a more invasive procedure, such as amniocentesis,” she added. But that benefit was not immediately obvious to critics unfamiliar with the spectrum of prenatal testing options. Dr. Bianchi received threats from people who saw testing fetal DNA as a way to avoid the births of people with Down syndrome and the other trisomies. Genetic screening and testing often aim to avoid a medical situation in a family, not to "improve" the genetic structure of a future population. And we should never assume that all families will choose that path.</indent><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Genetic Testing For All: Is It Eugenics?” Lewis, R. 2014. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLOSBlogs</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 1, false);

This theory predicts that in rich countries, the direct effects of income inequality represent generalizable or particular psychological processes that influence health outcomes. This so-called materialist theory does not emphasize emotion, but rather the actual living conditions of the rich and poor. Although there are no universal, unambiguous, and generally accepted interpretations of cause-effect relationships between measures of income inequality and general measures of population health, the relationship is clear at the individual level: low socioeconomic status predicts mental health problems such as clinical depression.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The Gini index is a tool used to measure the distribution of income across a population. Higher values indicate a more uneven distribution of income. After a 1995 economic depression in Finland led to record-high levels of income inequality, a study examined whether changes in municipal Gini index were linked to changes in the use of antidepressants in several Finnish municipalities (Figure 1). In order to calculate the Gini index, study participants were asked to compare their standards of living with those of their peers in the municipality where they live. Finland’s overall Gini coefficient was found to increase from 22.5 to 28 between 1995 and 2010.</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/psychsoc/EK3_Psychsoc_P4_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1 </b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">Antidepressant use among several populations during a period of increasing income inequality in Finland</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “Is Income Inequality ‘Toxic for Mental Health’?

ARF1 is also linked to recruitment of lipid modifying enzymes such as phospholipase D (PLD1) and phosphoinositol kinases to Golgi membranes as well as proteins involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation from Golgi membranes. Additionally, ARF1 regulates association of adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) and PLD1 on the cytosolic leaflet of lipid droplets.</indent><br/><br/><indent>ARF1 function is regulated by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP via an exchange factor, transitioning ARF1 from an inactive to an active conformation. This is then followed by hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, transitioning ARF1 back to an inactive conformation. Due to its intrinsically low GTP hydrolysis rate, ARF1 requires an activating protein for GTP hydrolysis. ARF1 is one of 5 ARFs associated with the Golgi apparatus through GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by an ARF GTP Activating Protein 1 (ARFGAP1).</indent><br/><br/><indent>Examination of human liver tissue revealed that ARFGAP1 is found associated with lipid droplets at steady state in some but not all hepatocytes. Researchers first treated hepatocytes with ARFGAP1-complementary siRNA. Following siRNA treatment, the cells were stained with Bodipy, a specific marker for lipid droplets. The results are shown in Figure 1.</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/physchem/EK3_Physchem_P5_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Lipid droplet area and count following ARFGAP1 knockdown</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “ARFGAP1 Is Dynamically Associated with Lipid Droplets in Hepatocytes.” Gannon J, Fernandez-Rodriguez J, Alamri H, Feng SB, Kalantari F, et al. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2014. 9(11) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0111309 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 6, false);

The genetic basis of DS has not been elucidated, although chromosome 13 micro-deletion or duplication has been reported. Some DS patients have elevated chromosome breakage and tumor formation, implying potential defects in DNA repair. While certain DS cases have abnormal production of immunoglobulins, many other cases did not display immunoglobulin deficiency at young ages. Bone marrow failures have been reported in a few cases of DS. These clinical phenotypes overlap with some DNA repair deficiency syndromes such as Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) syndrome, Fanconi anemia, DNA ligase IV syndrome, Bloom’s syndrome, etc. However, direct evidence for DNA repair defects in Dubowitz syndrome has not been reported.</indent><br/><br/><indent>In order to establish a more complete cellular and genetic characterization of Dubowitz syndrome, researchers generated a fibroblast cell line, CoDa, derived from the skin tissues of a patient with Dubowitz syndrome. Early passages of CoDa cells were used for growth property analysis, with a normal primary fibroblast control line (FBCL) used as a control. The CoDa cells displayed typical fibroblast morphology in primary culture, and had comparable growth properties and cell cycle distribution as normal skin fibroblasts at log-phase of growth. To test the radiation sensitivity of the CoDa cells, a colony formation assay was performed (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P3_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Survival of CoDa and FBCL cells following varying doses of radiation</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from: “Identification of the DNA Repair Defects in a Case of Dubowitz Syndrome.” J Yue, H Lu, S Lan, J Liu, MN Stein, B Haffty, and Z Shen. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS One</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2013. 8(1) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054389 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 3, false);

Improper maintenance of bone matrix can lead to many health issues depending on what substance is incorrectly regulated. These disorders include osteopetrosis and osteoporosis.</indent><br/><br/><indent>The members of the small leucine rich repeat proteins (SLRPs) regulate assembly and function of the ECM, particularly the collagen fibril networks, and include osteoadherin (OSAD) and chondroadherin (CHAD). CHAD contains 11 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and is classified as a SLRP based on its primary structure. It is highly expressed in cartilaginous tissues and is primarily located close to the cells. In bone CHAD has been implicated in direct interaction with calcium phosphate mineral. CHAD mediates adhesion of isolated chondrocytes by having the C-terminal chondroadherin sequence interact with cell surface proteoglycans, such as syndecans, that can act as receptors. Bone CHAD promotes attachment of osteoblastic cells and binds with high affinity to collagen types I and II.</indent><br/><br/><indent>CHAD also interacts tightly with both the N- and C-terminal globular domains of collagen type VI. As CHAD can interact with structural extracellular matrix molecules as well as with cells in the tissue, the protein may provide a mechanism for regulating cell activities in relation to ECM structure, and thus, play a role in both cartilage and bone homeostasis. To further study CHAD, researchers developed a transgenic mouse with inactivated CHAD genes. They subsequently analyzed bone and cartilage characteristics of these mice (Figure 1).</indent><br/><br/><center>https://ekexam-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mcat/mcatek-3/biology/EK3_Biology_P9_fig1.png</center><br/><br/><left></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><b>Figure 1</b></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Force required to fracture femoral neck in CHAD inactivated mice</left><br/><br/><small>This passage was adapted from “The Skeletal Phenotype of Chondroadherin Deficient Mice.” Hessle L, Stordalen GA, Wenglen C, Petzold C, Tanner EK, Brorson S, Baekkevold ES, Onnerfjord P, Reinholt FP and Heinegard D. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><i>PLoS ONE</i></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">. 2013. 8(6) doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063080 for use under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).</small></span>', 12, false);
